        <h3>SECTION 1</h3>
        <p>
            A week ago a friend invited a couple of other couples over for dinner.
            Eventually, the food (but not the wine) was cleared off the table for what
            turned out to be some fierce Scrabbling. Heeding the strategy of going for 
            the shorter, more valuable word over the longer cheaper word, our final play 
            was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–happens to be a Japanese Buddhist 
            festival, and not, as I had originally asserted while laying the tiles on 
            the board, one half of a chocolate-covered cherry treat. 
            Anyway, the strategy worked. My team only lost by 53 points instead of 58.
